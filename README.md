### Architecture / Conventions
- **BEM**: was invented at Yandex to develop sites which should be launched fast and supported for a long time. It helps to create extendable and reusable interface components. BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. (https://en.bem.info/)
